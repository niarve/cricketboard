# Cricketboard
###### Nathan Iarve

The purpose of this app was to make my roommates a simple scoreboard as a mobile application they could use to play cricket (darts).

This is a basic mobile application that uses the following technologies
* React-Native
* Redux

This app was developed primarily for iOS (Android implementation coming soon).

#### Installation
First, install Homebrew, then follow these instructions:
```sh
  brew install node
  npm install -g react-native-cli
```
Now create the project
```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/niarve/cricketboard.git
    $ cd cricketboard
    $ npm i
```

---

#### Development

###### iOS
```sh
    $ react-native run-ios
```
An iOS simulator will automatically appear with the app! Otherwise, you can also run the project by xcode by importing  ./ios/cricketboard.xcodeproj into xcode.

###### Android
```sh
    $ react-native run-android
```
App is currently untested in Android so be warned!
